# Add parallel with diversity?
What is diversity? How did the problem got solved?

# Disparate views on disparity?

 * literature search for "morphological disparity"
 * Get data in a table like
 
| Date | Author | Taxonomic Class | Data type | Data source | Morphospace | Disparity | Test |

 * expand the table beyond "morphological disparity" (check from Ian's reviews - ask data form him)

Data type (discrete, continuous, geomorph) 
Data source (whole organism, head, body)
Morphospace (PCA, PCO, MDS, distance matrix)
Metric (...)
Test (predictive, ...)



If these results are sufficiently general to apply to other clades and times, then the extreme heterogeneity 
observed in Palaeozoic crinoid evolution strongly suggests that fitting commonly used models of phenotypic 
evolution to phylogenies of extant species does not adequately capture the shifting dynamics of evolutionary 
radiations, especially those spanning timescales where extinction and/or recent radiations within subclades have 
overprinted the signal of a clade’s early history. Similarly, morphologic disparity is a complex “macroevolutionary 
currency”

 influenced by a wide range of possible causal mechanisms, including (but not limited to) rates of 
morphologic change, extinction selectivity, turnover rates, and the average duration of shared ancestry among

. Thus, inferences from palaeobiological studies of disparity may be misled in cases where a strict 1:1 
relationship between morphospace occupation and rates of phenotypic evolution is assumed. Even if step size 
transitions derived from disparity curves adequately capture early burst dynamics during early stages of diversifi-
cation (Fig.

), the extent to which disparity patterns are subsequently decoupled from morphologic rates remains 
poorly understood and needs to be furthered tested with other clades. In cases where morphologic changes can be 
estimated from phylogenetic trees and/or ancestor-descendant pairs, additional comparisons between rates and 
disparity offer fruitful opportunities to develop a more nuanced understanding of morphologic diversification.
