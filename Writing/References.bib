              (i.e., disparity). Whether the extremes of disparity were
              achieved early in animal evolutionary history or clades
              continually explore the limits of possible morphospace is subject
              to continuing debate. Here we show, through analysis of the
              disparity of the animal kingdom, that, even though many clades
              exhibit maximal initial disparity, arthropods, chordates,
              annelids, echinoderms, and mollusks have continued to explore and
              expand the limits of morphospace throughout the Phanerozoic,
              expanding dramatically the envelope of disparity occupied in the
              Cambrian. The ``clumpiness'' of morphospace occupation by living
              clades is a consequence of the extinction of phylogenetic
              intermediates, indicating that the original distribution of
              morphologies was more homogeneous. The morphological distances
              between phyla mirror differences in complexity, body size, and
              species-level diversity across the animal kingdom. Causal
              hypotheses of morphologic expansion include time since
              origination, increases in genome size, protein repertoire, gene
              family expansion, and gene regulation. We find a strong
              correlation between increasing morphological disparity, genome
              size, and microRNA repertoire, but no correlation to protein
              domain diversity. Our results are compatible with the view that
              the evolution of gene regulation has been influential in shaping
              metazoan disparity whereas the invasion of terrestrial ecospace
              appears to represent an additional gestalt, underpinning the
              post-Cambrian expansion of metazoan disparity.",

              replicate inquiline microbial communities were maintained for

              one-third of all living vertebrate species and assume a

              assembly of modern acanthomorph biodiversity remains largely
              unexplored. Here, I reconstruct the trajectory of morphological
              diversification in this major radiation from its first appearance
              in the Late Cretaceous to the Miocene using a geometric
              morphometric database comprising more than 600 extinct species
              known from complete body fossils. The anatomical diversity
              (disparity) of acanthomorphs is low throughout the Cretaceous,
              increases sharply and significantly in the wake of the
              Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-P) extinction, and shows little change
              throughout subsequent Cenozoic intervals. This pattern of
              morphological diversification appears robust to two potential
              biasing factors: the 'Lagerst{\"a}tten effect', and the
              non-random segregation of rare and common taxa along phenotypic
              axes. Dissecting the trajectory of acanthomorph radiation along
              phylogenetic lines reveals that the abrupt post-extinction
              increase in disparity is driven largely by the proliferation of
              trophically diverse modern groups within Percomorpha, a spiny-fin
              subclade containing more than 15 000 living species and
              identified as showing a substantially elevated diversification
              rate relative to background vertebrate levels. A major component
              of the Palaeogene acanthomorph radiation reflects colonization of
              morphospace previously occupied by non-acanthomorph victims of
              the K-P. However, other aspects of morphological diversification
              cannot be explained by this simple ecological release model,

              function and suggest that this emergent property of complex
              systems promotes the evolution of physiological diversity. Our
              work has focused on a 4-bar linkage found in labrid fish jaws
              that transmits muscular force and motion from the lower jaw to
              skeletal elements in the upper jaws. Many different 4-bar shapes
              produce the same amount of output rotation in the upper jaw per
              degree of lower jaw rotation, a mechanical property termed
              Maxillary KT. We illustrate three consequences of many-to-one
              mapping of 4-bar shape to Maxillary KT. First, many-to-one
              mapping can partially decouple morphological and mechanical
              diversity within clades. We found with simulations of 4-bars
              evolving on phylogenies of 500 taxa that morphological and
              mechanical diversity were only loosely correlated (R(2) = 0.25).
              Second, redundant mapping permits the simultaneous optimization
              of more than one mechanical property of the 4-bar. Labrid fishes
              have capitalized on this flexibility, as illustrated by several
              species that have Maxillary KT = 0.8 but have different values of
              a second property, Nasal KT. Finally, many-to-one mapping may
              increase the influence of historical factors in determining the
              evolution of morphology. Using a genetic model of 4-bar evolution
              we exerted convergent selection on three different starting 4-bar
              shapes and found that mechanical convergence only created
              morphological convergence in simulations where the starting forms
              were similar. Many-to-one mapping is widespread in physiological
              systems and operates at levels ranging from the redundant mapping
              of genotypes to phenotypes, up to the morphological basis of
              whole-organism performance. This phenomenon may be involved in
              the uneven distribution of functional diversity seen among animal

              then declined sharply, and remained significantly low until the

              among biological forms that have become an integral part of the
              analytical toolkit of evolutionary biologists and
              palaeobiologists. Nevertheless, the term morphospace brings
              together a great variety of spaces with different geometries. In
              particular, many morphospaces lack the metric properties
              underlying the notions of distance and direction, which are,
              however, central to the analysis of morphological differences and
              evolutionary transitions. The problem is illustrated here with
              the iconic morphospace of coiled shells implemented by Raup 50
              years ago. The model, which allows the description of shell
              coiling geometry of various invertebrate taxa, is a seminal
              reference in theoretical morphology and morphospace theory, but
              also a morphometric framework frequently used in empirical
              studies, particularly of ammonoids. Because of the definition of
              its underlying parameters, Raup's morphospace does not possess a
              Euclidean structure and a meaningful interpretation of the spread
              and spacing of taxa within it is not guaranteed. Focusing on the
              region of the morphospace occupied by most ammonoids, I detail a
              landmark-based morphospace circumventing this problem and built
              from the same input measurements required for the calculation of
              Raup's parameters. From simulations and a reanalysis of
              Palaeozoic ammonoid shell disparity, the properties of these
              morphospaces are compared and their algebraic and geometric
              relationships highlighted. While Raup's model remains a valuable
              tool for describing ammonoid shells and relating their shapes to
              the coiling process, it is demonstrated that quantitative
              analyses of morphological patterns should be carried out within
              the landmark-based framework. Beyond this specific case, the
              increasing use and diversity of morphospaces in evolutionary
              morphology call for caution when interpreting patterns and
              comparing results drawn from different types of morphospaces.",

              mammals is widely considered low and strongly size-dependent
              (allometric), possibly due to developmental constraints arising
              from the altricial birth of marsupials. However, species whose
              skulls are impacted by strong muscular stresses - particularly
              those produced through mastication of tough food items - may not
              display such intrinsic patterns very clearly because of the known
              plastic response of bone to muscle activity of the individual. In
              such cases, allometry may not dominate within-species shape
              variation, even if it is a driver of evolutionary shape
              divergence; ordination of shape in a geometric morphometric
              context through principal component analysis (PCA) should reveal
              main variation in areas under masticatory stress (incisor
              region/zygomatic arches/mandibular ramus); but this main
              variation should emerge from high individual variability and thus
              have low eigenvalues. Results: We assessed the evidence for high
              individual variation through 3D geometric morphometric shape
              analysis of crania and mandibles of three species of
              grazing-specialized wombats, whose diet of tough grasses puts
              considerable strain on their masticatory system. As expected, we
              found little allometry and low Principal Component 1 (PC1)
              eigenvalues within crania and mandibles of all three species.
              Also as expected, the main variation was in the muzzle, zygomatic
              arches, and masticatory muscle attachments of the mandibular
              ramus. We then implemented a new test to ask if the landmark
              variation reflected on PC1 was reflected in individuals with
              opposite PC1 scores and with opposite shapes in Procrustes space.
              This showed that correspondence between individual and ordinated
              shape variation was limited, indicating high levels of individual
              variability in the masticatory apparatus. Discussion: Our results
              are inconsistent with hypotheses that skull shape variation
              within marsupial species reflects a constraint pattern. Rather,
              they support suggestions that individual plasticity can be an
              important determinant of within-species shape variation in
              marsupials (and possibly other mammals) with high masticatory
              stresses, making it difficult to understand the degree to which
              intrinsic constraints act on shape variation at the
              within-species level. We conclude that studies that link micro-
              and macroevolutionary patterns of shape variation might benefit
              from a focus on species with low-impact mastication, such as
              carnivorous or frugivorous species.",

  abstract = "Few studies have critically evaluated how morphological variation
              within individual organisms corresponds to variation within and
              among species. Subindividual variation in plants facilitates such
              studies because their indeterminate modular growth generates
              multiple serially homologous structures along growing axes.
              Focusing on leaf form, we evaluate how subindividual trait
              variation relates to leaf evolution across Viburnum, a clade of
              woody angiosperms. In Viburnum we infer multiple independent
              origins of wide/lobed leaves with toothed margins from ancestors
              with elliptical, smooth-margined leaves. We document leaf
              variation along the branches of individual plants of 28 species
              and among populations across the wide range of Viburnum dentatum.
              We conclude that when novel leaf forms evolved in Viburnum, they
              were intercalated at the beginning of the seasonal leaf sequence,
              which then generated a repeated spectrum of leaf forms along each
              branch (seasonal heteroblasty). We hypothesize that the existence
              of such a spectrum then facilitated additional evolutionary
              shifts, including reversions to more ancestral forms. We argue
              that the recurrent production of alternative phenotypes provides
              opportunities to canalize the production of particular forms and
              that this phenomenon has played an important role in generating

  author   = "Adams, Dean C and Collyer, Michael L",
  abstract = "Recent years have seen increased interest in phylogenetic
              comparative analyses of multivariate data sets, but to date the
              varied proposed approaches have not been extensively examined.
              Here we review the mathematical properties required of any
              multivariate method, and specifically evaluate existing
              multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods in this context.
              Phylogenetic comparative methods based on the full multivariate
              likelihood are robust to levels of covariation among trait
              dimensions and are insensitive to the orientation of the data
              set, but display increasing model misspecification as the number
              of trait dimensions increases. This is because the expected
              evolutionary covariance matrix (V) used in the likelihood
              calculations becomes more ill-conditioned as trait dimensionality
              increases, and as evolutionary models become more complex. Thus,
              these approaches are only appropriate for data sets with few
              traits and many species. Methods that summarize patterns across
              trait dimensions treated separately (e.g., SURFACE) incorrectly
              assume independence among trait dimensions, resulting in nearly a
              100\% model misspecification rate. Methods using pairwise
              composite likelihood are highly sensitive to levels of trait
              covariation, the orientation of the data set, and the number of
              trait dimensions. The consequences of these debilitating
              deficiencies are that a user can arrive at differing statistical
              conclusions, and therefore biological inferences, simply from a
              dataspace rotation, like principal component analysis. By
              contrast, algebraic generalizations of the standard phylogenetic
              comparative toolkit that use the trace of covariance matrices are
              insensitive to levels of trait covariation, the number of trait
              dimensions, and the orientation of the data set. Further, when
              appropriate permutation tests are used, these approaches display
              acceptable Type I error and statistical power. We conclude that
              methods summarizing information across trait dimensions, as well
              as pairwise composite likelihood methods should be avoided,
              whereas algebraic generalizations of the phylogenetic comparative
              toolkit provide a useful means of assessing macroevolutionary
              patterns in multivariate data. Finally, we discuss areas in which
              multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods are still in need
              of future development; namely highly multivariate

              morphological disparity is common, little is known about the
              underlying dynamics that drive this decoupling. Early in the
              history of the Cambrian trilobite family Pterocephaliidae, there
              was an increase in taxonomic diversity and morphological
              diversity. As taxonomic diversity declined in the later history
              of the clade, range of variation stayed high and disparity
              continued to increase. However, per-branch rates of morphological
              evolution estimated from a recent phylogeny decreased with time.
              Neither within-trait nor within-species variation increased or
              decreased, suggesting that the declining rates of morphological
              evolution were more likely related to ecological opportunity or
              niche partitioning, rather than increasing intrinsic constraints.
              This is further supported by evidence for increased biofacies
              associations throughout the time period. Thus, the high disparity
              seen at low taxonomic diversity late in the history of this clade
              was due to extinction - either random or targeting mean forms -
              rather than increased rates of morphological evolution. This

              appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems
              requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple
              components of stability, most ecological research has focused on
              one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we
              present a new view of ecological stability that recognises
              explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This
              provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We
              illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field

              ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various

              perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among

              increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter
              the relationships among components of stability in different

              isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the
              potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In

              relation of a landmark configuration to some a priori index or
              suite of indices of function. When an index is itself a generic
              mathematical or biomechanical shape function of landmark
              locations, meaning a dimensionless expression that has a nonzero
              gradient everywhere in the feasible region of morphospace, the
              question becomes sharper: how can we exploit it as a reference
              direction for representations within the realm of the customary
              geometric morphometric (GM) analyses? This article argues that
              the only valid approach to this problem is geometric, not
              statistical: to represent any such a priori index by way of its
              differential (its gradient) calculated as an explicit vector in
              the Procrustes dual space of the complete list of landmarks
              whether or not involved in the formulation of the index.
              Interpretation of the index follows by comparing its direction
              after this embedding with other interesting directions in the
              same shape space, such as principal warps, relative warps, group
              mean shape contrasts, specific form factors extracted
              independently, or directions corresponding to other functional
              indices. Here, I work an artificial but realistic example of this
              technique in complete detail: the construction of a Procrustes
              shape formula exactly aligned with a specific angle among three
              landmarks within an arbitrary configuration of six. A closing
              discussion traces the spirit of this intervention to comments by
              W. W. Howells and C. E. Oxnard, originally intended for
              anthropometric contexts other than GM, on the different purposes

              taxonomic and/or ecological groups based on broad patterns of
              skull shape, particularly the relative length and width of the
              snout. However, these patterns have not been quantitatively
              analyzed in detail, and their biomechanical and functional
              implications are similarly understudied. Here, we use geometric
              morphometrics and finite element analysis to explore the patterns
              of variation in crocodilian skull morphology and the functional
              implications of those patterns. Our results indicate that skull
              shape variation in extant crocodiles is much more complex than
              previously recognized. Differences in snout length and width are
              the main components of shape variation, but these differences are
              correlated with changes in other regions of the skull.
              Additionally, there is considerable disparity within general
              classes such as longirostrine and brevirostrine forms. For
              example, Gavialis and Tomistoma occupy different parts of
              morphospace implying a significant difference in skull shape,
              despite the fact that both are traditionally considered
              longirostrine. Skull length and width also strongly influence the
              mechanical performance of the skull; long and narrow morphotypes
              (e.g., Tomistoma) experience the highest amount of stress during
              biting, whereas short and broad morphotypes (e.g., Caiman
              latirostris) experience the least amount of stress. Biomechanical
              stress and the hydrodynamic properties of the skull show a strong
              relationship with the distribution of crocodilians in skull
              morphospace, whereas phylogeny and biogeography show weak or no
              correlation. Therefore, ecological specializations related to
              feeding and foraging likely have the greatest influence on

              tendency for animal clades to reach their maximum morphological
              variety relatively early in their evolutionary histories (early
              high disparity). We present a meta-analysis of 98 metazoan clades
              radiating throughout the Phanerozoic. The disparity profiles of
              groups through time are summarized in terms of their center of
              gravity (CG), with values above and below 0.50 indicating top-
              and bottom-heaviness, respectively. Clades that terminate at one
              of the ``big five'' mass extinction events tend to have truncated
              trajectories, with a significantly top-heavy CG distribution
              overall. The remaining 63 clades show the opposite tendency, with
              a significantly bottom-heavy mean CG (relatively early high
              disparity). Resampling tests are used to identify groups with a
              CG significantly above or below 0.50; clades not terminating at a
              mass extinction are three times more likely to be significantly
              bottom-heavy than top-heavy. Overall, there is no clear temporal
              trend in disparity profile shapes from the Cambrian to the
              Recent, and early high disparity is the predominant pattern
              throughout the Phanerozoic. Our results do not allow us to
              distinguish between ecological and developmental explanations for
              this phenomenon. To the extent that ecology has a role, however,
              the paucity of bottom-heavy clades radiating in the immediate
              wake of mass extinctions suggests that early high disparity more
              probably results from the evolution of key apomorphies at the

              to enhance our understanding of variation in ecological and

              morphological diversity in a family of small mammals, the tenrecs
              (Afrosoricida, Tenrecidae). Tenrecs are often cited as an example
              of an exceptionally morphologically diverse group. However, this
              assumption has not been tested quantitatively. We use geometric
              morphometric analyses of skull shape to test whether tenrecs are
              more morphologically diverse than their closest relatives, the
              golden moles (Afrosoricida, Chrysochloridae). Tenrecs occupy a
              wider range of ecological niches than golden moles so we predict
              that they will be more morphologically diverse. Contrary to our

              morphologically diverse than golden moles when measured in
              lateral view. Furthermore, similarities among the species-rich
              Microgale tenrec genus appear to mask higher morphological
              diversity in the rest of the family. These results reveal new

	abstract = {Multidimensional analysis of traits are now a common toolkit in ecology and evolution and are based on trait-spaces in which each dimension summarise the observed trait combination (a morphospace or an ecospace). Observations of interest will typically occupy a subset of this trait-space, and researchers will apply one or more metrics to quantify the way in which organisms {\textquotedblleft}inhabit{\textquotedblright} that trait-space. In macroevolution and ecology these metrics are referred to as disparity or dissimilarity metrics and can be generalised as space occupancy metrics. Researchers use these metrics to investigate how space occupancy changes through time, in relation to other groups of organisms, and in response to global environmental changes, such as global warming events or mass extinctions. However, the mathematical and biological meaning of most space occupancy metrics is vague with the majority of widely-used metrics lacking formal description.Here we propose a broad classification of space occupancy metrics into three categories that capture changes in volume, density, or position. We analyse the behaviour of 25 metrics to study changes in trait-space volume, density and position on a series of simulated and empirical datasets.We find no one metric describes all of trait-space but that some metrics are better at capturing certain aspects compared to other approaches and that their performance depends on both the trait-space and the hypothesis analysed. However, our results confirm the three broad categories (volume, density and position) and allow to relate changes in any of these categories to biological phenomena.Since the choice of space occupancy metric should be specific to the data and question at had, we introduced moms, a user-friendly tool based on a graphical interface that allows users to both visualise and measure changes space occupancy for any metric in simulated or imported trait-spaces. Users are also provided with tools to transform their data in space (e.g. contraction, displacement, etc.). This tool is designed to help researchers choose the right space occupancy metrics, given the properties of their trait-space and their biological question.},

However, there has been considerable debate surrounding the reliability of these inferences in the absence of fossil data (9{\textendash}13), and to date this critical question remains unresolved. Here we mathematically clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant timetrees under the generalized birth-death model, which underlies the majority of existing estimation methods. We prove that for a given extant timetree and a candidate diversification scenario, there exists an infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to have generated a given tree. These {\textquotedblleft}congruent{\textquotedblright} scenarios cannot possibly be distinguished using extant timetrees alone, even in the presence of infinite data. Importantly, congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly different and yet plausible diversification dynamics, suggesting that many previous studies may have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence. We show that sets of congruent models can be uniquely described using composite variables, which contain all available information about past dynamics of diversification (14); this suggests an alternative paradigm for learning about the past from extant timetrees.},
