\section{Introduction}

%NC: OK I think this paragraph needs some rewriting. At present it's unclear to me what you're trying to tell me with this paragraph. Are you trying to tell me about the history of disparity? Are you trying to define it and tell me about the debates surrounding that? I think mostly you're aiming for the latter, but this needs to be much clearer. Try and be a bit more upfront about what you're doing, and don't be afraid of short, clear sentences without any fancy words. i.e. epistemiology and ontology helps no-one! Also note that you start by saying disparity = morphology, then you say it could be anything but people argue about it, then you say it can be anything. So perhaps you need to start broad and then say one type of disparity, and the most commonly analysed, is morphological, and that's what most people would think of when hearing the term. But it could apply to anything. 

%1 -
% History of disparity methods
%Since the time of the ancient, it has been observed that variation in morphologies often follows discrete patterns rather than a continuous gradient of forms. % NC: Since the time of the ancients is super clunky. I've tried something different
Even classical scholars recognised that variation in the shape and form of organisms often follows discrete patterns rather than a continuous gradient.
% NC: changed the next bit as you need to define disparity/introduce it. As previously written it was hiding in a bracket.
Disparity analysis, the study of differences among these clusters of morphological groups, was popularised in seminal palaeobiology papers in the 1990s [Runnegar 1987, Gould, Foote, Webb, etc.].
Since then, disparity has been used to describe biological, phenotypic, and/or trait variation without strict distinction between the ontology and epistemology (see Semantics Box) 
% NC: Or glossary rather than semantics?
% NC: I have no idea what you mean with this ontology and epistemiology comment. 
Over the last 30 years, disparity has been most commonly used in the context of morphological disparity.
The impressive amount of literature published since then tackles a vast array of biological questions, using different (sometimes contrasted) methods but often consists studies of the phenotype at a macroevolutionary level (i.e. species or above).
To date, there is no consensus on whether disparity should be restricted and specific to these kind of studies or whether it should be used as a broader umbrella term designating studies of multivariate variation, not restricted in its questions, methods and disciplines.
Throughout this review, we aim to highlight the diversity of disparity analyses and how they can help understanding or provide a structure to biodiversity.
In essence, we suggest that disparity is a pattern of variation.

%2§ what use: commonly used
% NC: I feel like this perhaps need to fit in to the paragraph above, where you're saying it can be used for lots of things? 
The description of these patterns % NC: what patterns?
 has been used to tackle a vast array of questions.
For example, it has been used (1) in Evo-devo to tackle questions of
%evo-devo
Developmental constraints [CITE];
Relationship between form and function and evolution functional traits [CITE] or
Scaling micro to macro [CITE];
% Ecology
(2) in ecology or palaeoecology to study:
intra-specific competition [CITE],
niche occupants, speciation and competition[CITE] or
macroecology (disparity in space)[CITE];
% Evolution
(3) on in macroevolution to study:
response to extinction and selectivity [CITE],
intra-specific competitive replacements [CITE] or
more globally, tempo and mode of evolution [CITE].

%3§ problems %NC: Could maybe put the subheading "best practices" here?
Disparity studies have a great deal of promise in helping us to understand the evolution of biological diversity.
With the expansion of methodological approaches in the last decade, however, we also identify three main issues that, if not tackled could reduce the power of such analysis.
First, many recent studies have lost focus; they are no longer hypothesis-driven, instead they are undertaken to characterise biological variation for its own sake.
Second, even where there is a clear question being explored, the data being used for disparity analyses is inappropriate and often driven by the availability of large datasets.
Third, the methods being used to analyse these datasets may not always be appropriate for the question and/or data at hand.
Here we deal with some of these issues and present best practice guidelines to allow researchers to optimise their questions before performing a disparity analysis.

\subsubsection{[Box]Disparity patterns or processes}
\label{box_semantic}
At the core of defining what \textit{is} disparity lies a potential divide between epistemology and ontology: % NC: Can you either just write out what these terms mean, or add the explanation in brackets? I hate un-necessary jargon. Most PhD students will not be familiar with these terms. Were you before you got into this? (maybe you were, maybe the French education system is better!)
is there a difference between the pattern (and how researchers characterise it) and how it was ultimately generated?
If disparity describes patterns of variation, the underlying scientific question ultimately always needs to use them as a proxy for explaining the biological processes.
In the seminal papers from the late 80s, disparity was used to describe and understand the Cambrian explosion where both the pattern (high dissimilarities among groups) was directly linked to the process (an explosive radiation of multicellular life as championed by Gould REF).
Restricting disparity to this initial informal definition (multidimensional morphological dissimilarity at a macroevolutionary scale) can be advantageous for advances in this field but broadening it will allow more interdisciplinary discussion.
In recent years, disparity has been used to investigate ecological processes, disconnected from evolution (e.g. function [CITE], community structure[CITE], competition[CITE]).
Thus disparity % NC: I'm still unclear what you mean when you say disparity here. Do you mean the methods, the idea of discrete groups? I'm struggling a bit to parse how it can "inform us" per se.
could not only inform us on macroevolutionary patterns and processes but also something about environments and ecosystem functioning (with the advantages of easily allowing palaeocological and palaeoenvironemental perspectives).
\subsubsection{[Box]End}
% NC: I think I prefer the previous version where you actually had a subsection to discuss this within the text rather than a box. Seems particularly weird as you als odo some defining of disparity in the first paragraphs. Maybe move that into the box? Then just say here we define dispairty as "XXXX" in the text. Or shorten this and put it within the text? See what works. But the point of a box is to add details not needed in the text, so if it's in the text anyway then I'm dubious about the box...

\section{Best practices for disparity analysis}

\section{Find a question} %NC: I wonder if "find a question" is exactly what we mean here. This suggests you've decided to use disparity whatever happens, and just need the right question. Maybe change to What is your question? 
Why are you performing a disparity analysis?
This seems like it should be obvious, but we stress its crucial importance.
The last decade has seen a vast array of new methods being published and implemented in freely available software, making disparity analyses easy to perform \citep{bouxin2005ginkgo,oksanen2007vegan,geiger2008,zelditch2012geometric,adams2013geomorph,Claddis,dispRityv02,adams2017geometric}.
However, this (consciously or not) pushes authors towards performing disparity analyses simply because of their ease of use, rather than stemming from a question driven approach.
Before rushing into a disparity analysis, one should consider some basic caveats.
For example, one major thing to consider is circularity: if the aim is to explore the variation in a dataset, disparity analysis is perfectly valid.
However, if this exploratory analysis reveals distinct groups, it would be circular to then test for differences among those groups as if this had been your hypothesis all along [CITE stats 1.0].
This can easily be avoided by using a subset of the data for preliminary data exploration, and then using the full dataset to test for differences among any groups that emerge.
Clearly framing your questions and their null expectations will help in designing better disparity analyses.

\section{Collect the appropriate data}
% If disparity is used to describe patterns that are explained by a certain process, every possible data will always only be a proxy for these patterns. % NC: Don't really understand your point here.
Once you have a clear question, it is important to collect the appropriate data for that question to avoid some major caveats.
For example, if a study focusses on the ecological adaptive radiation of a group, ecological traits are crucial and should be preferred over purely evolutionary traits.
Tangentially, more data are not necessarily better, especially when the data were originally collected for different questions (e.g. cladistic data - see below).

\subsection{Which types of data?} % NC: Not sure having these subheadings as Q looks best, maybe just Data types?
Morphological disparity analysis can be based on three main types of data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item discrete data that can be either describing a feature (often referred to as ``cladistic''; e.g. the presence or absence of legs, the colour of a tail, etc. [CITE]) or counts (e.g. number of digits, etc. [CITE]);
    \item continuous data that can be either simple measurements (e.g. body length, etc. [CITE]) or more abstracted methods (e.g. geometric morphometrics, mathematical contour description, etc. [CITE]);
    \item or any mixture of discrete and continuous data (e.g. ratios [CITE]).
\end{enumerate}
None of these types of data are fundamentally better but each will be more appropriate for specific questions.
For example, when investigating variation within bat wing shapes, homologous landmarks (for geometric morphometrics analysis) or continuous measurements of bones may be appropriate.
On the other hand, if the question focuses on the convergence between bat and bird wings, the homology of the traits to measure is more complex to define and the contour of the wings might more readily answer the question. % NC: This section might need more explanation and/or some more examples

\subsection{How much data to collect?}
Regardless of the type of data, another important consideration is how much data to collect, in terms of numbers of both specimens and traits.
There are several important considerations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Taxonomic scope}
    Morphological disparity has been studied at both inter-[CITE] and intra-specific levels [CITE].
    Taxonomic scope will depend on the question being investigated, and what type of variation is being analysed.
    For example, when studying skull shape plasticity in canids, it is essential to include intra-specific variation to capture the full variety of skull shapes, particularly that seen in domestic dogs (CITE).
    Conversely, if a study focuses on canid skull variation through time, interspecific data is most appropriate.
    % intra-specific variation will not have major impact (up until the Holocene). %http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/650372
    \item \textit{Sample size}
    There is always a trade-off between collecting enough data and the time allocated to a project.
    It is important to ensure that the data is collected in a way that will not bias subsequent statistical analysis.
    For example, if the aim is to compare disparity among groups, one should collect, where possible, a similar amount of data for each group.
    When this is not possible (e.g. for palaeontological data), one should use statistical approaches to correct or assess biases due to data collection (e.g. rarefaction analysis [CITE]).
    Equally, one should ensure that enough data is available so that the methods have power to detect the patterns being tested.
    \item \textit{Are the data consistent?} %NC: Not suer I get this section. What do you mean by consistent???? Also does this fit into the "how much data" section or is it a seaprate consideration?
    This is maybe the most important question related to the nature of the data.
    It is essential that the data is consistent and homogeneous to make sure that the disparity patterns can be linked to general processes rather than being simply the reflection of idiosyncrasies in the data set.
    For example, are the observed differences between two groups not related to the group's specificities (e.g. sexual dimorphism)?
    Are the elements fairly consistent and comparable them?
    Data can be missing, non overlapping, hierarchical (e.g. inapplicable), ambiguous, polymorphic or correlated.
    In any of these cases, are the patterns a mere reflection of these inconsistencies?
    For example, if one uses disparity analysis of locomotory modes among vertebrates and the collected data is hierarchical, limb data could create an artificial grouping of non-tetrapods and limbless tetrapods (e.g. snakes) that could not reflect processes.
\end{itemize}
Of course in practice some of these caveats are unavoidable. 
Data collection is often constrained by the time available, financial considerations and other unavoidable issues, however, these caveats should be kept in mind during the analyses and subsequent interpretation of the results. % NC: I'd be tempted to move this to the end of the section to finish it off.

\subsection{Recycling data}
A common practice in disparity analysis is to recycle data from other studies which can introduce additional problems.
One classic case is using ``cladistic'' data in palaeobiology.
These data are usually collected for phylogenetic analysis and are thus designed to maximise differences among taxa to recover a clear phylogenetic signal.
This data can therefore artificially lead to maximised disparity among taxa [Foote - crinoids non-cladistic paper].
A relatively simple way to reduce this specific bias is to select the most pertinent characters for the question from the dataset, rather than using all the data.
For example, in a study of disparity of dietary niches, removing non-dietary characters is a good approach.
However, it is important to remember that there is no one-to-one mapping between form and function, and that some characters can have multiple functions (e.g. limb traits can be used for both locomotion and feeding).
%Ultimately, whether the data was collected for the purpose of the study or is recycled, and whether any of the caveats described above are taken into account, disparity patterns will eventually be measured and analysed in another multitude of ways a we suggest that, whenever possible, this should first and foremost be considered in the design of the data collection protocol. 
%NC: Not sure these linking statements are needed

\section{Use appropriate methods} 
In the vast majority of morphological disparity analyses, the methodological approach will be multidimensional.
Multidimensional analysis can be a powerful tool for analysing complex datasets but also comes with many mathematical caveats and limitations.
As with any great power, it comes with great responsibility. % NC: Ha are we citing spiderman too? Awesome
The first step in any statistical analysis should be to visualise the data to understand its distribution and limitations.
Unfortunately, we can only perceive a maximum of three dimensions at the same time.
Therefore one of the main challenges in multidimensional analysis is how to reduce the number of dimensions, both for visualisation and analysis (see box \ref{box_ordination}).

\subsection{Visualising the multidimensional problem}
\label{visualisation}
It is important to remember that visual interpretations of multidimensional data can easily be misleading.
For example, it is incorrect to assume that because some groups overlap on a bivariate or three dimensional plot, that they overlap across the whole multidimensional space (especially if the space is not Euclidean).
Conversely, when two groups do not overlap on a two or three dimensional plot, this does not mean they never overlap in the multidimensional space.
Furthermore, multidimensional spaces are not necessary Euclidean.
Such non-Euclidean spaces often have non-intuitive properties, for example straight lines in some dimensions are not straight in the space and, even less intuitively, the distance between points A and B might not be equal to the distance between points B and A [CITE Sylvain].

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/dimensionsOverlap.pdf}
\caption{\small{Two groups that overlap in some dimensions do not necessary overlap in all dimensions. 
Conversely, two groups that do not overlap in some dimensions can overlap in other dimensions. 
In this example, no group overlaps in the multidimensional space despite the appearances.}} 
% NC: Might need to explain more clearly, I'm not 100% sure I got your meaning
\label{Fig:RF_results_best}
\end{figure}

It is therefore vital to be clear about what is represented in multidimensional space visualisations.
In fact, it can be easy (intentionally or not) to mislead a reader into over/under interpreting a pattern if all the key properties of the space are not present in the graph.
We suggest visualisations should include the following:
(1) the percentage of the variation explained by each axis of the plot (i.e. is the majority - or all - the variation of the data present in the plot or only a fraction?);
(2) the scale of the axes (ideally, if the space is orthogonal, it is important to keep the same scale across the axes);
and (3) the error associated with each point, whether this is in terms of measurement error (on ordination plots for example) or some other measure of standard variation (in further analysis, e.g. disparity through time).
Finally, it is important to remember that for any dimensionality reduction of a multidimensional problem, the visual result will be at best a distortion of the measured reality, at worst, it will be misleading.

\subsection{[Box]To ordinate or not to ordinate (that is the multidimensional question)?}
\label{box_ordination}
One of the most common approaches to analysing multidimensional data is to use ordination techniques.
These consist of transforming the dataset along its major axis of variation through various mathematical methods [Legender \& Legendre].
This is generally done via three analysis pipelines:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item data -> distance matrix -> ordination
    \item data -> zscores -> principal components analysis (PCA)
    \item data -> Procrustes superimposition -> projection into tangent space -> PCA
\end{enumerate}
%TG: Check with Melanie for the figure? - apparently she has one.

%Why to ordinate: % NC: This box seems quite long, can it be reduced?
These pipelines reduce the dimensionality of the data.
This is advantageous for plotting and visualising the data (see Visualisation section \ref{visualisation}) which can reveal properties of the morphospace not captured by the metrics (see Metrics section \ref{metrics}).
Additionally, after ordinating the data it is possible to further reduce the number of dimensions by only selecting a certain number of axes (e.g. selecting only the axes that describe up to 95\% of the variation).
In the case of geometric morphometric data (point 3 above), ordination is particularly useful as it conserves the mathematical properties of the data while efficiently reducing the dimensions: the PCA reflects the number of degrees of freedom (resulting from the superimposition), its geometry is conserved (coordinates remain Euclidean when projected into tangent space and ordinated), etc. % NC: is the stuff after the : needed in this sentence?
This has clear advantages for interpreting the results.
For example, the axes will represent gradients of biological variation (e.g. elongation and flattening of the beak REF).
This also allows easy interpretation of the proximity of the elements in space which reflect shared biological characters.
%%%%%%%%%%%
However, some caveats can arise from such transformations of the data.
For example, in the case of an ordination in a geometric morphometric data context, not using all the axes from the ordination (e.g. only the first few) can lead to misinterpretation of the results.
Furthermore, interpreting biological variation along the axes is always a \textit{post-hoc} procedure and might have little relation to the disparity question (e.g. if the first few axes represent the elongation and flattening of the beak, but the question is about wing disparity).
In many cases, depending on the question, ordination might not be necessary.
For example, if the disparity metric being used (see below) relies on all the data (for example the sum of variance or the sum of ranges) it is not necessary to calculate it on ordinated data [e.g. CITE Close].
Additionally, in some cases, reducing the dimensionality of a dataset can render its interpretation more problematic.
For example, when the analysed data is non-Euclidean (e.g. discrete morphological characters), the ordination can be problematic (due to character hierarchy, inapplicable characters, polymorphisms, and missing data), and the resulting non-Euclidean ordinated space can be difficult to interpret.
This can be problematic when comparing the position of groups in the multidimensional space, as the measured distances might not be comparable.
Furthermore, the \textit{post-hoc} interpretation of the gradient of variation on the ordination axes can be impossible or biologically meaningless (e.g. the ratio of data coded as 1 rather than 0). % NC: Need to explain this point more clearly

Because of these points, we strongly recommend that data for multidimensional analyses is not automatically ordinated, and that careful consideration is given to whether the question can be answered without ordination.
\subsection{[Box] end}

\subsection{Phylogeny}
For many disparity analyses of macroevolutionary questions, phylogeny is often taken into account, whether for including estimates of ancestors or to add phylogenetic structure to the data.
For the latter, multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods have been reviewed recently by [CITE Adams] %https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/67/1/14/3867043
and therefore will not covered further in this review.

\subsubsection{Ancestral state estimation}
When looking at disparity in the past (e.g. disparity-through-time) ancestral state estimations are a common approach.
Ancestral state estimation can be performed in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item pre-ordination: the estimation is done before transformation of the data (e.g. ordination, or distance matrix construction) and is simply based on the original dataset[CITE].
\item post-ordination: the estimation is done after transformation of the data by estimating the ancestral states based on the transformed matrix (e.g. the ordination scores) [CITE].
\end{enumerate}
Pre-ordination ancestral state estimation can change the ordinated space's geometry (i.e. the relationship between the points not estimated) and implies longer computational method but once the morphospace is defined, it will remain constant (i.e. its properties won't change).
Post ordination ancestral states estimation will not change the ordinated space geometry and will be faster to compute, however, it will change the morphopspace's properties such as the number of parameters (i.e. elements in the space - this can be problematic for statistical tests down the line) or the variance per axis [CITE Graeme's paper to be?].

More importantly, however, one needs to keep in mind that using such methods can come with several caveats.
First and foremost, although ancestral states estimations are valid methods in macroevolution, they results are highly dependent on the data and chosen methods.
Secondly, more specific to disparity analysis, when using post-transformation ancestral states estimation, the morphospace can be saturated leading pairwise distance bases metrics to tend to zero.
In general, using ancestral states estimation can bring much insights for recovering patterns of changes in disparity but should not be ``used'' simply to generate extra data points for statitstical reasons.
In fact, these extra points are not independent and can also generate side effects which can be problematic, especially when testing the effect of extinctions events on disparity.

Alternatively, ancestral states estimation can be used to provide realistic null expectations from the data.
In disparity through time analysis, it is possible to sample many ancestral states estimates on the nodes and along to branches to test whether the recovered pattern could be simply explained by the phylogenetic structure itself rather than the morphological changes.
Furthermore, this method can be pertinent for fitting modes of evolution and see if the recovered disparity metric can be explained by the tested modes of evolution.


\subsection{Metrics}
\label{metrics}
 
[INCLUDE WILLS FIGURE HERE]

After building and visualising the morphospace, one can use disparity metrics (or indices) as a one dimensional summary of it to test hypotheses.
Because of these reduction in dimensionality, these metrics are bound to only reflect some aspect of the morphospace and can never encompass its whole complexity.
With that in mind, the choice of the metric should be essential to summarise the aspect of the morphospace that is the most related to the question.
In an unidimensional distributions (e.g. histograms) different metrics will readily reflect different aspect of the data.
For example, metrics can be used to reflect the ``size'' of the distribution (e.g. the range, quantiles or variance) and some other will reflect the most likely value (the central tendency - e.g. the mean, median or mode).
Among these metrics, some will have more preferable properties than other such as sensitivity to outliers (range, mean or mode \textit{vs.} quantiles, variance or median) and will thus be more or less appropriate to the different questions.

In multidimensionality, this high availability of unidimensional descriptors comes with equally numerous advantages and caveats.
If the question refers to ``size'' of a group in the morphospace (e.g. ``does group A occupy as much space as group B?''), metrics relating to the spread of the group in the morphospace are the most appropriated (e.g. volume [CITE], variance [CITE], range [CITE], distance from the centroid [CITE]).
Conversely, if the question refers to the ``position'' of a group in the morphospace (e.g. ``does group A occupy the same space as group B?''), metrics relating to the distance of the elements to a point are most appropriated (e.g. distance from a fixed point - e.g. the opposite group).
Finally, one might also be interested in the density of elements in some regions of the morphospace (e.g. ``is group A more dense than group B?''), metrics relating to the pairwise distances between elements are most appropriated (e.g. nearest neighbour distance, pairwise distances, etc.)

When looking at this positively, any metric can be suitable to any question, when looking at it negatively, it is important to keep in mind several caveats that can apply in any case:
First, it is important to relate the metrics to the space property.
For example, measuring the sum of variances of the space's dimensions does not require the co-variance element between the axis in a PCA but only when the full space is considered: if only a subset is measured, co-variance should be added to the sum of variances.
Second, some metrics automatically relate to the properties of the morphospace.
For example, range or hull based metrics are really sensitive to outliers and thus biased based on the sample size.

Of course some other aspects could be of interest (or more than one) and thus some other metrics would be more appropriated.
For example, differential changes (in direction or relative magnitude) of sum of ranges and sum of variances can be indicative of different modes of extinction selectivity (e.g., Korn et al 2013, Evolution).
Furthermore, one future avenue that could be explored is to go beyond single valued disparity metrics and rather express them in terms of distributions.
For example, when the metric is expressed as the median distance from centroids [e.g. in CITE], it could be informative as well to express it as a full distribution.
This would allow to both visualise the variation at a glance and use this variation in statistical tests for comparing these distributions.

Best practices:
\begin{itemize}
\item Facing the amount of different ways to measure disparity and regardless which metric is the most suited to the question, it is crucial to clearly and mathematically define the metric in a disparity paper. The definition can be in plain English: e.g. ``we measure disparity as the sum of the variance of each axis of the ordinated matrix''; or mathematically: e.g. ``we measured disparity as $\sum\sigma_i$ where $\sigma_i$ is the variance of the each ordinated axis $i$.''.
\item It is important to keep in mind that different metrics can lead to the same results even though the described spaces are different (the opposite is \textit{not} true). We therefore suggest to always plot some dimensions of the space (see Visualisation section \ref{visualisation}) and try multiple metrics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tests}
Similarly to all the points covered above, which statistical test to apply solely depends on which question is tackled with disparity analysis (i.e. which hypothesis to test).
On the other hand, some tests (such as permanovas [CITE]) are actually \textit{not} taking into account the disparity measured but are simply based on the distribution of the taxa into the space (or simply their pairwise distances in the case of PERMANOVAS).

Furthermore, bootstraps are often used in morphological disparity analysis as a mean to get a distribution from a single disparity value [CITE].
While this method is valid in itself, it comes with several caveats.
First, it is important to consider that bootstrapping the disparity values creates a distribution of them (e.g. a distribution of sum of variances from a bootstrapped morphospace).
Therefore, the error associated with the bootstrap is reflecting the ``stability'' of the metric, not the extremes of the distribution of the data (\textit{c.f.} when bootstrapping a disparity distribution; e.g. the distribution of all the distances from centroids from a bootstrapped morphospace).
In the first and most common case, the amount of bootstraps artificially increases the type I error.
Furthermore, when comparing two groups, the comparison is one of the disparity of two groups using their ``stability'' as variance. 

Best practices:
\begin{itemize}
\item make sure your metrics are capturing what you are testing
\item check out the test assumptions
\item Know if and how your dataset is violating assumptions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Models}
One 
What are our null hypotheses?
Joe’s simulations’ stuff - phylogeny can be used to build a null.One basic null is that disparity increases with diversity; how do we diverge from that (show these morpho/genome distance divergence/convergence).
We can have a null model that is based on simple Brownian increase in disparity (gradual). 
Null: is the null increase in disparity dependent on a random walk and on a tree shape?
Maybe we don’t want to think about a null model but rather think about good models to fit. 
We haven’t explored much about fitting models like explaining holes, effects of extinction etc…

Are there lessons/methods from other fields we use?
Sample sizes: we need to be careful about them! (e.g. for detecting holes etc.).

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{text:intro}

% Biodiversity is not a smooth gradient of forms, functions, ecologies, behaviours, etc., but it is rather variable and discontinuous. %TG: Actually is it?
% This is at the base of biological sciences and is linked to the concept of disparity \citep{Wills2001,Hopkins2017} with the observation that some groups of species are more similar or dissimilar than others.
% This diversity in morphologies is in fact proper in nature and decoupled from taxonomic diversity: some groups may exhibit low diversity of species by high diversity of shapes \citep[or the other way around]{ruta2013,hopkinsdecoupling2013}.
% In palaeobiology, this concept, has been studied since the 90s describing \citep{gould1989wonderful,gould1991disparity,briggs1992morphological,Wills1994,Foote01071994,Foote29111996,jernvall1996molar,foote1997evolution} and as been extended with modifications to macroevolutionary analysis in general since the 2000s (whether based on continuous traits; e.g. \citealt{Harmon961,geiger2008}; or on geometric morphometrics; e.g. \citealt{claude2008morphometrics,zelditch2012geometric,adams2013geomorph,adams2017geometric}).

% Since then, morphological disparity has been used for testing a vast array of biological hypotheses such as: how did body plans evolve through time? \citep{Wesley-Hunt2005}; why does some morphologies exist and not other? \cite{gerber2017geometry}; what is the tempo and mode of morphological innovations through time? \citep{Hughes20082013}; what is the effect of mass extinction on disparity? \citep{halliday2016eutherian}; how does competition between groups affect disparity? \citep{Brusatte12092008}; how did morpho-ecological niches get filled through time? \citep{price2014niche}; and many more.
% %
% This apparent versatility of morphological disparity analysis led to a phenomenal amount of papers based on disparity methods (Fig. \ref{Fig:GoogleOccurences})!
% %
% However, ``a lot of disparity studies are inductive fishing trips and are not often designed to test a specific hypothesis.''
% %
% Indeed, compared to the vast amount of publication using morphological disparity, only a handful highlight/solve problems and propose hypothesis testing.

The data was collected on the 1st of November 2017.}

% \section{What actually \textit{is} disparity?}

% \cite{prentice2011} define disparity as: ``a term widely (albeit not always consistently) used to describe the range of forms in a group of organisms, or the difference among different body plans''.
% Disparity can describe either the metric (\citealt{Wills2001}; or index \citealt{Hopkins2017}) or the whole pipeline \citep{zelditch2012geometric,lloyd2016estimating}.
% To assess the usage of disparity in different published studies, we collected methodological data from the 500 first Google Scholar results for the key words ``morphological disparity'' per order of appearance (accessed on the 1st of November 2017).
% For the 230 relevant papers among the 500 matches, we collected the following methodological data: (1) What was the focal biological group? ; (2) What kind of data was measured (e.g. landmarks, discrete data, etc.)?  ; (3) Was data collected on the full organism or not? ; (4) How was the morphospace explicitly defined (e.g. PCA, PCO, MDS, etc.)? ; (5) How was the disparity metric(s) explicitly defined? ; (6) Which statistical test was applied to test the disparity related hypothesis? ; (7) Was phylogeny taken into account or not?
% We used only the explicit definition of the morphospace and the disparity metric(s) in this search since a few number of papers had a vague definition of either or both (e.g. a disparity metric was measured but not described anywhere in the paper).
% The remaining 270 matches were disparity was mentioned but not measured felt in the following categories: papers out of topic, papers mentioning morphological disparity without measuring it, review papers, papers not accessible (either through a broken link or a paywall) or referenced citation without the paper (as a Google Scholar match).
% To reduce the amount of categories for the 230 recorded methods, we concatenated different methods in a smaller number of categories (see supplementary materials and \url{https://github.com/TGuillerme/Disparity_Working_Group/blob/master/Analysis/data_cleaning.Rmd}).

% \begin{figure}[!htbp]
% \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/MethodsProportions.pdf} 
% \caption{Disparity methods proportional usage: (1) Data type: which input data was used (...); (2) Morphospace: how was the morphospace obtained (...); (3) disparity: what type of disparity metric was calculated (...); (4) test: what type of test was applied (...).}
% \label{Fig:MethodsProportions}
% \end{figure}

% From the collected data, we can highlight the use of three main different disparity analysis with their associated data/morphospace/metric/tests and related to specific methodological implementations.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{The ``\texttt{Claddis}'' approach:} this group of methods uses discrete morphological data (sometimes referred to as ``Cladistic'' characters) for the full organisms to build a PCO from the organism's pairwise distance as a morphospace. Disparity is then often measured as a variation of the ordinated matrix dimensions' variances or ranges (e.g. the sum of variance or/and the sum of ranges). Hypothesis are often tested using multivariate ANOVAs on the pairwise distance matrix or by simply comparing the confidence intervals overlap of the disparity from different groups. 

%     \item \textbf{The ``\texttt{geomorph}'' approach:} this group of method is based on landmark data (2D or 3D) on parts of the organism studied usually the skull) and use a Procrustes transformation of the landmarks that are then directly ordinated using a PCA (but sometimes RWA). Disparity is often measured as a distance metric (e.g. the distance between the species and a point in the morphospace such as its centroid). Hypothesis are then tested using ANOVA type tests with usually no phylogenetic correction (although phylogeny is sometimes used to correct the morphospace).

%     \item \textbf{The ``\texttt{approach}'' approach:} this method can directly use continuous or discrete data for the full organism without any ordination (but not necessarily), and will measure disparity as the average pairwise distance between species (whether euclidean or any other type of distance). Hypothesis of higher/lower disparity can then be measured using null evolutionary models.
% \end{itemize}

% %
% The advent of these three approaches coincides with the explosion of disparity analysis (Fig. \ref{Fig:GoogleOccurences}) and suggest a high popularity of disparity analysis.
% %
% Unfortunately, however, few actual tests have been performed on whether any of these approaches \textit{actually} allows to tackle the classic disparity questions (see \ref{text:intro}{Introduction}).
% Are all these methods the right tools to answer these questions are they mere ``inductive fishing trips'' used to describe the data rather than testing any of the hypothesis related to the disparity questions?

% \section{Does data used in disparity analysis allows to test hypothesis?}
% In fact, the question of which data to analyse \citep{hetherington2015cladistic} and which part of the data to use has been analysed \citep{hopkins2017well} has rarely been assessed.
% Can the data used in disparity studies actually test the phenomenon researchers are trying to capture?

% For example, when studying discrete morphological characters (often following the ``\texttt{Claddis}'' approach), the data used is often recycled data used for phylogenetic analysis.
% These datasets are usually design to recover evolutionary history and differentiate clades and, often due to the preservations of the fossil record, are mainly based on hard tissue characters.
% In phylogenetics, this artefact have been shown to be leading to measurable topological recovery error (for soft \textit{vs} hard characters; \citealt{sansomfossilization2013}; or dental \textit{vs} cranial characters \citealt{sansom2017dental}).
% Therefore, is the morphospace composed of ``fossilisable'' characters enough for answering evolutionary hypothesis?
% For example, are niche replacement hypothesis equivalent to fossilisable-character-based-niches replacement hypothesis?

% Similarly, many studies in geometric morphometric are based solely on skull shape using landmark techniques combined with Procrustes superimposition \citep[the ``\texttt{geomorph}'' approach;][]{zelditch2012geometric,adams2017geometric}.
% However, it has been shown that the whole skeleton displays different integrated modules with different specific evolutionary constraints leading to variable rates and modes of evolution (\citealt{Goswami20130254}; and this even at the cranial level \citealt{goswami2010influence}).
% Is skull variation enough for measuring body plans variation through time for example?

% In the case where disparity is measured a single continuous trait (or a collection of traits; following the ``\texttt{geiger}'' approach), for example in \cite{price2014niche}, beak and limb length as well as body mass are used to differentiate groups of birds and different zones in the morphospace can then be interpreted as different niches.
% Is this set of traits studied in isolation sufficient to test niche occupancy hypothesis?

% Additionally, in many cases, the disparity metrics and hypothesis are often based on a transformation of the data (pairwise distances, PCA, PCO, MDS, RWA, etc.).
% Can these transformation readily reflect the raw data in our hypothesis?
% For examples a morphospace as a pairwise matrix reflects the dissimilarity between the data, a morphospace based on an ordination reflects the variability within the data, a morphospace based on both reflects the variability within the dissimilarity, are each method reflecting that?

% \section{Do the disparity metrics (or indices) really reflect variation in the studied phenomenon?}
% From the 230 papers analysed, we found 104 unique combination's of metrics to measure disparity (Fig. \ref{Fig:MethodsProportions}).
% Commonly, these metrics are used to approximate the volume occupancy within the morphospace \citep{Wills2001,DonohueDim,diaz2016global}.

% However, it has been shown that different metrics reacts differently depending on the dataset \citep[][; and an anecdotal example in Fig. \ref{Fig:DimensionsEffect}]{Wills2001,Ciampaglio2001}.
% For example metrics involving a product of aspects of the matrix (e.g. the volume, the product of the dimensions) are likely to suffer from the \textit{Curse of dimensionality} \citep{bellman1957dynamic} and will quickly tend to null values.
% Some other metrics are not representing all the data captured in the morphospace (e.g. the sum or product of variance ignores the co-variance between dimensions).
% Are these metrics as a description of the ordination a good proxy for the observed biological phenomenon?


% \begin{figure}[!htbp]
% \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/DimensionsEffect.pdf} 
% \caption{Effect of the number of dimensions on different disparity metrics (note that the sum of variance is equal to the average squared pairwise distance in this case).
% The data used is one of the example datasets from the \texttt{dispRity R} package \citep[\texttt{BeckLee\_mat50};][]{beckancient2014,dispRityv02} composed of 50 elements and 48 dimensions obtained from a ordination (MDS) of the distance matrix of a discrete morphological character matrix.}
% \label{Fig:DimensionsEffect}
% \end{figure}

% Despite these caveats, it is important to actually know what the metrics are measuring.
% There has been some attempts to test that through simulations \citep{Ciampaglio2001,  gerber2017geometry} but it is still unclear which metric reflects the best the hypothesis test.
% For example, the average squared pairwise distance (or the sum of ranges) are really popular \citep[e.g.][]{geiger2008} yet has been shown to be fairly senstive, at least in empirical data to the number of sampled taxa, the number of characters and the data completeness \citep[][; although effects were lesser in simulations]{Ciampaglio2001}.
% More fundamentally, the question arises whether one disparity metric could be sufficient to describe changes in disparity?
% Changes in multidimensions might not be readily grasped by unidimensional metrics!
% For example, a given taxonomic group might have the exact same volume as another one yet be in a complete different part of the morphospace \citep[or even overlap or not depending on the dimensions;][]{davis2012acanthodes,brusatte50}.
% In this case, it might more interesting to have multiple metrics (e.g. the position and the volume) [FABRE et. al in prep.] or to use distributions of metrics (e.g. what does the average distance between species or from a point really convey? Is the distribution not more interesting?).

% Maybe we need metrics that fit explicitly our hypothesis (or fit our hypothesis directly to the metric).
% For example, for competitive replacement, should we not measure whether group A occupies the same place as group B through time and whether that is due to competition or simply because any other place in the space cannot be occupied (and why are such spaces unoccupied)?


% \section{Is the current statistical toolkit sufficient for testing disparity hypothesis?}
% Are the methods used to test hypothesis in disparity actually testing what we think they're testing (problem of multidimensional hypothesis)
% What does an anova or related variance based test real infirm/confirms regarding the disparity questions?
% How do we deal with bootstrapped data and pseudo-replications?
% Can we realistically use univariate Gaussian models to test hypothesis based on multivariate, probably non-Gaussian data? \citep{blomberg2017beyond}

% Should be take phylogeny into account? \citep{polly2013phylogenetic}



% \section{What are we missing?}

% \subsection{Learning lessons from other fields}
% In ecology, disparity bears strong parallels with $\beta$-diversity in ecology (a measure of ecological communities (dis)similarity): one biological observation described by a vast array of metrics \citep{baselga2010partitioning, anderson2011navigating, donohue2016navigating}.

% \section{Conclusion}
% We need a more hypothesis driven way of analysing disparity.
% Disparity methods should be the tool for answering disparity hypothesis, not merely a description of the data.

% \subsection{Disparity data}
% The data used for disparity methods comes from three main sources:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Continuous data such as limb or body measurements \citep{slaterCetacean}.
%     \item Discrete morphological characters \citep[sometimes referred to as ``Cladistic'' characters; ][]{Brusatte12092008}.
%     \item Geometric morphometric data which is generally the Procrustes transformation of 2D or 3D landmarks \citep{cooney2017mega}.
% \end{itemize}

% However, data was by far not limited to these three categories (e.g. colours \citealt{maia2013key}; metabolic rate \citealt{nespolo2016studying} or chemicals signal \citealt{garcia2017heterogeneous}).

% \subsection{Morphospaces}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item PCAs [CITE].
%     \item PCOs [CITE]
%     \item Pairwise distance matrices \citep[no ordination; ][]{Harmon961}.
% \end{itemize}

% But also RWA [CITE] or Raup-spaces [CITE].

% \subsection{Disparity metrics}
% Throughout the 230 analysed papers, we found 103 unique combinations of metrics!

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Distances measurements between species or from a certain point in the morphospace [CITE].
%     \item Ranges and variances of each axis of the morphospace \cite{Wills2001,Ciampaglio2001}
%     \item Distance between species based on the pairwise distance matrix (not the ordinations) [CITE].
% \end{itemize}

% But also metrics based on the volume [CITE], the characters dissimilarity [CITE] or the coordinates of some axis of the ordination [CITE]

% \subsection{Disparity hypothesis}
% Describing the many outputs (what and how is it tested):

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Variance based (ANOVA, etc.) [CITE].
%     \item Correlation based [CITE].
%     \item Regression based (PGLS, etc.) [CITE].
% \end{itemize}

% But also discriminant analysis [CITE] and clustering [CITE].

% Of course some studies use a combination of these three methods or none of them at all!

% Also, among each category XX\% of studies use multiple approaches.

% How to compare disparity between methods?

% Can we really say things about competition when looking at disparity in a single group?

% Are all characters equal? Character contingency suggests otherwise

% What is the relationship between disparity and tree shape?

% Do we have a null model for investigating disparity?

% Can we really say things about competition when looking at disparity in a single group?


% \noindent \hl{\textit{Disparity in other fields}}

% In ecology, disparity bears strong parallels with $\beta$-diversity in ecology (a measure of ecological communities (dis)similarity): one biological observation described by a vast array of metrics \citep{baselga2010partitioning, anderson2011navigating, donohue2016navigating}.

% \section{Conclusion}

% A quick guideline for good disparity analysis:

% Maybe we need something like in Parham et al 2012 (Best Practices for Justifying Fossil Calibrations): an easy an identifiable description of the pipeline containing: 1) the type of data, 2) the morphospace and 3) the metric?
