Hi Thomas,

Thanks for sending this. I have looked over the email thread but only skimmed the paper so far. I guess broadly speaking that (after looking up what didactic means) I am in agreement with Phil’s view there is maybe too much emphasis on a didactic approach so it can end up coming across as admonishing past research rather than setting the scene for a new era of exciting disparity research. I do think that this is subjective though - I have grown to dislike “you should do this” type papers but others like it. It might be at the stage of asking for general perspectives, rather than edits.  So you could just send this version (maybe as read only to prevent a shit show) to coauthors and ask if they think the general tone is appropriate with specific options on (a) the current structure vs (b) Phil’s traditional approach (I would just give the alternative structure rather than presenting it as Phil’s view). If there is a consensus that  the current form is OK then it could in as is or with some additional minor editing. I agree with you that when you send it for editing it basically needs to be minor stuff or else it will be iterated to death.

Alternatively, if you can wait a bit longer I’d be happy to make a first pass at editing to see if an independent perspective can manage to bring Phil’s suggestions into the structure without screwing up everything that you and Natalie have done.

Let me know what you think. 

Cheers
Gavin

Hi Phil
 
I see your point about this not reading like a traditional review paper, but I think it’s a difficult re-write as a traditional review. To keep all the didactic stuff that I think we all agree is super important we can’t add too much to the text. Thomas and I have tried a lot of different approaches, and each time it didn’t really work. This is the result of about five different iterations and is the first that makes sense and says what we agreed we wanted to say.
 
I like the structure of the kinds of questions that people ask, as I think it sets out the problems much more clearly than just going into a lot of examples. I completely see your point that these examples are not properly explored, but a *lot* of examples are clearly missed out. I don’t think this was ever going to be a review in the sense of “here is all the recent literature using these methods”, and if we start reframing it that way I can see it drawing heavy criticism for not fully reviewing the literature. You could argue that is what we should do, but we probably need to be realistic about the limited time we all have to work on this. 
 
A possible solution here is that rather than bending backwards to make this what Biology Letters wants (and knowing that even if we do so it may still get rejected), we could instead aim it at Methods in Ecology and Evolution or similar. We still submit it to Biology Letters, but I think we don’t need to do a complete overhaul again. Unless Phil you’ve got some time to rewrite the intro to show Thomas what you mean? 
 
What do you think?
 
In terms of your other points, 
 
Agree that we can beef up those didactic points. And also a bit more of a gloom laden end to the intro would help justify its existence.
 
I also agree (from the second email you sent back to Thomas today) that we won’t all agree on all of this. I think the easy solution is that Thomas as first author you have final say on what gets said, and then if Emma (or anyone else) doesn’t want to be associated with that she can remove her name from the paper.
 
Have a great weekend!

Hi Thomas
 
I’ve been through the review and made some minor edits. You’ve done a really good job.
 
I remain a little concerned that it doesn’t read much like a review or even an opinion piece – it’s more didactic – and as such I’m not sure that it fits with what Biology Letters are expecting (whatever that is). The general structure of a good review is something of a shit sandwich:
 
This field of research is really exciting. Something about the origins and evolution of the field/approach
These are really cool studies that exemplify the kinds of questions and discoveries made in the field
Err…but there’s something really wrong here… Summarise the things that are a bit screwy – where ambition or interpretation has over reached data and methods
This is how things should be done
If we can do these things properly, we’ll be able to do all these cool things – isn’t this field of research exciting?
 
At the moment, we have 
 
This field of research is really exciting. Something about the origins and evolution of the field/approach
These are the kinds of questions that are being asked
This is how things should be done
 
We don’t have to follow a prescribed formula in writing the review, but we need to justify why readers need to be told how things should be done, and the best way to do that is through examples, which returns us to the traditional structure. If you agree, the changes are not revolutionary. The part of the introduction that deals with the style of questions asked just needs to be inverted – describing studies and their results as examples of the kinds of questions asked (rather than merely citing examples of studies that have asked classes of questions). 
 
The bit that I think is missing is the justification for the didactic section. This could be done by ending the introduction with a doom laden litany of the problems with existing disparity studies, segueing to the existing sections which I think need to be rearticulated around examples – of studies that have these shortcomings and those that have overcome them. Contextualising the issues in this way, with practical described examples, makes them more readable and digestible.
 
I don’t think the text is sufficiently direct either on issues such as:
 
Proxy data: can anatomical samples be taken as representative of the whole organism? Is a disparity study based on trilobite cephala anything more than that? Is it a representative analysis of the disparity of the whole organisms? Well, that depends on the question you are asking, and few studies reflect on this in interpretation. This is a more general issue as it speaks to whether palaeontological data are representative of anything more than a disparity of fossilizable characters – Deline et al. (2018) suggests not – producing very biased perspectives on disparity. It also impacts on questions like ecological and functional disparity which are really just analyses of anatomical characters involved in function or ecology, which is not (necessarily) the same thing.
The other cardinal sin seems to be interpretation based heavily on ordination, much of which is visual. This appears increasingly dodgy – yet most of the past cadre of work is based on such an approach. 
 
I’ve rambled on too far – I need to know what you and Natalie think before I ramble any further.
 
Best wishes, Phil.
